JS - Basic 
------------
Word vd Key word 
Word - words no meaning in the JS , but the Keyword holds some value in JS 
word - anything like mobile , run intensity
key word - > where, for , char, function, if, else, var, constant, 


Variables and Constants
---------------------------
-the values that store soething , and can be changed when we want, 
weight can be changed after some time, temeprature, speed of car

-Constants -> our lives i.e 1 , sun in earth is  a constant. etc
-let-> from let we can  


hoisting ->
------------
console.log(a);
var a//declaration = 18 //initilization; 
in the above example , the value of a is prinited as undefined not //error, but in ither lanuages we get erreor , called hoisting.

still we can print the value undefined not error   this is called Hoisting , same we can use for the Function.
-we can use a  variable before the value assiging 
defn - variable and function are hoisted which there declaration is moved on the top of code.
