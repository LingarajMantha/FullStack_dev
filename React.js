React js is usually used for the better user experience , like when we are moivng from one page to another 
like www.google.com to www.google.com/blog , so usually before page used to load/buffer while moving from one page to other ,,, 
  now if we try to move with React.js , it wont even load, HENCE it is Single page loading ,, which gives people a better user experinece.

Features of ReactJS
->Its a javascript libraray 
-> used to build single page application and helps developer to build the web page based on compononent wise (header is on componenet , footer and Body differenlty , usefull for developer)
->when ever an user clicks on some componenet in the UI , only that part loads , like while useing the insta nd fb , if we click on some componenet 
only that will change, not the whole page 
->React js is view layer of MVC - (model view controller)
